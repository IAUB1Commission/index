**Challenges and Innovations in Computational Astrophysics VI**

*A Hybrid Meeting covering all areas of Computational Astrophysics*

**September 29 - October 2, 2025**

*IISER Mohali, India*

**Rationale:**

This is the 6th edition of the ChaICA series of meetings on computational astrophysics organised by IAU Commission B1: Computational Astrophysics. The meeting provides a forum especially for early-career researchers to present to their peers their work on computational algorithms, methods and new software projects. The talks can be a mix of both numerical methods and scientific results, but the focus of the meeting is on the computational and programming aspects. It is less formal than a scientific symposium, and so presentations on work-in-progress that does not yet have any scientific application/results are warmly welcomed.

**Topics to be covered:**

1. Data Management & Mock Catalogs

2. AI/ML Aided Simulations 

3. Astrophysical Codes in the Era of GPU

4. Cosmological codes with Subgrid Models 

5. Multi-scale simulations

6. Advances in Stellar Evolution codes

7. Particle Simulations and Kinetic Plasma codes.

**Invited Speakers**

1. Keiya Hirashima;	University of Tokyo,	Japan

2. Hsi-Yu	Schive;	National Taiwan University,	Taiwan

3. Prateek Sharma;	IISc, Bangalore	India

4. Wladimir	Lyra;	New Mexico State University,	USA


**Important Dates:**

March 10, 2025 : *First Announcement*

March 20, 2025 : *Registration and Abstract Submission Starts*

April 30, 2025 : *Abstract Submission Ends*

May 31, 2025 : *Selected Abstracts will be informed*
