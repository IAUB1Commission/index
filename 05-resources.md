| [Gadget-2]() | Volker Springel (MPA) | GADGET is a code for cosmological N-body/SPH simulations on massively parallel computers with distributed memory.<details> GADGET uses an explicit communication model that is implemented with the standardized MPI communication interface. The code can be run on essentially all supercomputer systems presently in use, including clusters of workstations or individual PCs. GADGET computes gravitational forces with a hierarchical tree algorithm (optionally in combination with a particle-mesh scheme for long-range gravitational forces) and represents fluids by means of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). The code can be used for studies of isolated systems, or for simulations that include the cosmological expansion of space, both with or without periodic boundary conditions. In all these types of simulations, GADGET follows the evolution of a self-gravitating collisionless N-body system, and allows gas dynamics to be optionally included. Both the force computation and the time stepping of GADGET are fully adaptive. GADGET can therefore be used to address a wide array of astrophysically interesting problems, ranging from colliding and merging galaxies, to the formation of large-scale structure in the Universe. With the inclusion of additional physical processes such as radiative cooling and heating, GADGET can also be used to study the dynamics of the gaseous intergalactic medium, or to address star formation and its regulation by feedback processes. </details>| [Springel 2005]() | C | GNU GPLv2 |  Web, public
| [GIZMO]() | Philip F. Hopkins (Caltech) | GIZMO is a flexible, massively-parallel, multi-physics simulation code. <details>The code lets you solve the fluid equations using a variety of different methods -- whatever is best for the problem at hand. It introduces new Lagrangian Godunov-type methods that allow you to solve the fluid equations with a moving particle distribution that is automatically adaptive in resolution and avoids the advection errors, angular momentum conservation errors, and excessive diffusion problems that limit the applicability of “adaptive mesh” (AMR) codes, while simultaneously avoiding the low-order errors inherent to simpler methods like smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH). Meanwhile, self-gravity is solved fast, with fully-adaptive gravitational softenings. And the code is massively parallel — it has been run on everything from a Mac laptop to > 1 million CPUs on national supercomputers. It includes a variety of physics including magnetohydrodynamics, self-gravity, cosmology, radiative heating/cooling, radiation-hydrodynamics, sink particles, star and black hole formation and “feedback”, anisotropic conduction and viscosity, turbulent eddy diffusion, dust/particulate dynamics, non-standard dark matter and dark energy models, elastic and plastic dynamics, giant impact/material models, shearing boxes and large-eddy/driven-turbulent boxes, and more.</details> | [Hopkins et al. 2015]() | C | GNU GPL |  Bitbucket, public
| [HARM-COOL]() | Agnieszka Janiuk | GR MHD code to simulate black hole accretion with optional nuclear Equation of State and neutrino cooling.<details> MPI-parallelized, 3D simulation of accretion and jet ejection in the Kerr metric around rotating black hole, in case of the gamma-ray burst engine, is its main application.The code was built upon the HARM-2D General Relativistic scheme for magneto-hydrodynamical simulations for black hole accretion (Gammie et al. 2003). It was extensively upgraded and supplied with novel functionality. The EOS functions are computed for the Fermi Gas of free proton, neutron, electron-positron, under arbitrary degeneracy (Yuan 2005). Tables with the equation of state and neutrino cooling are tabulated in the function of temperature and density and dynamically stored during the simulation. The physical units adopted in the code are scaled with the black hole mass and density scale in the accretion disk. The interpolation over EOS tables is implemented within the conversion scheme between conserved and primitive variables in GR MHD solver. In addition, code makes use of the tracer particles, and stores output on them for the subsequent post-processing of the r-process nucleosynthesis. Output formats in current version are ASCII and HDF5.This version, as of 2020, was developed since 2012, by Agnieszka Janiuk, Ireneusz Janiuk, and Kostas Sapountzis.
